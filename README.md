# Home-Assist_sensors
For those boards you need a ESP and for the Openterm device you need a special board that can handle >10V to TLL voltage.

# energie-meter P!-sensor
The P1-sensor with bitbang serial communication. So you don't need external chips to invert the signal from the energy meter. This causes the communication to be less stable, however you can easily miss a message without problems.

# ESP WiFi thermostat standalone
When you do not have Home-assistant you can use this thermostat.

# ESP Home Assistant OpenTerm
Connect any compatible OpenTerm CV with Home Assistant. Using MQTT
